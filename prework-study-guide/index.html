      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. A function is different from a for loop because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
      <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into code; the code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
      <li>Else if statements can be used to add more than one condition</li>
      <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is realated in some way.</li>
      <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
      <li>A for loops contains three important statements: the first determines the starting point for our loop. The second is the condition. THe third statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
      <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, so that it may be edited later.</li>
